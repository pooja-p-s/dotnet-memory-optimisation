### Stack Allocation 
# Stack allocation is a memory management technique that allows for efficient use of memory by allocating space on the stack rather than the heap.
# Utilize "stackalloc" for efficient temporary memory storage, reducing heap memory usage.
# Avoid unnecessary heap allocations by using stackalloc for temporary arrays or buffers.


### Use Pointer Types to Manage and Update the Order Book Efficiently

# Declare and initailize Pointer types for order book entries
# Implement metjods to add and remove entries from the order book using pointer types.
# Utilize "NativeMemory" for for unmanaged memory allocation and deallocation.


##Fixed Statement
# Use the "fixed" statement to pin memory locations for pointer types, ensuring that the garbage collector does not move them during execution.
# This is particularly useful when working with unmanaged memory or when interfacing with native code.
# The fixed statement allows you to work with pointers safely, ensuring that

#Memory safety
#Pin variables during critical operations to ensure
stable pointers and avoid data corruption.


#Fixed Size Buffers
# Use fixed-size buffers to manage memory efficiently, especially for scenarios where the size of the data is known at compile time.
# Fixed-size buffers allow for direct memory access and manipulation, improving performance in scenarios like order book management or high-frequency trading applications.
